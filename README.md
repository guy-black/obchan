# OBchan
## a simple image board made with the Obelisk
This will be a simple *chan styled image board with heavily commented code when done.  This seems like a fun simple project to learn how to build a full stack application with Haskell and  [Obelisk](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk).

### Done
 - Routes
 - Database
 - Backend
 - barebones frontend
 - watched and rewatched several hours of lectures on frp
 - achieved total enlightened
 - got it to compile and run, load threads on first visit, goes to a thread once you posted it.
 - some basic css styling
 - /p/x redirects to x's op if x is a comment
 - comment box clear and thread refreshes after comment sent
 - main page now renders the thread op and three last comments
 - threads are ordered by last activity, bump works
 - paging
