# OBchan
## a simple image board made with the Obelisk
This will be a simple *chan styled image board with heavily commented code when done.  This seems like a fun simple project to learn how to build a full stack application with Haskell and  [Obelisk](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk).

### Done
 - Routes -first try
 - Database -first try
 - Backend -first try
 - barebones frontend -first try
 - watched and rewatched several hours of lectures on frp
 - achieved total enlightened
 - got it to compile and run, load threads on first visit, goes to a thread once you posted it. 
### Current project
 - when /p/url isnt OP, scroll to it in the thread
 - when comment is posted could use basically the same thing as when a thread is posted
 - click on a thread to view whole thing
 - infinite scroll / paging
 - layout posts/comments better
 - Enable images
### TODO
 - >greentext
 - link to comment with >>[id number]
 - clean and comment up the code
